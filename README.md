# Image_Classifier
This repository contains keras image classifier that can classify whether the given image is of a dog or cat
 
In our examples we will use two sets of pictures, which we got from Kaggle: 1000 cats and 1000 dogs (although the original dataset had 12,500 cats and 12,500 dogs, we just took the first 1000 images for each class). We also use 400 additional samples from each class as validation data, to evaluate our models.

That is very few examples to learn from, for a classification problem that is far from simple. So this is a challenging machine learning problem, but it is also a realistic one: in a lot of real-world use cases, even small-scale data collection can be extremely expensive or sometimes near-impossible (e.g. in medical imaging).
